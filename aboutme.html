<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hello! My name is Nick Baldassini. I graduate from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor of Science in Visual Communications. Currently I work at Hult as the Facilities Coordinator for the
international housing facility in Oakland. I am the main point of contact for all maintenance, cleaning, and securtiy issues in the entire building. I also work on the weekends as a floater, food runner, and busser  at a sports bar called Hi Tops, located between Church and Castro station of San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors surfing at the beach, hanging out at the park, or just chilling with some friends. I also really enjoy going to music festivals all around the world. I love most types of music but my favorite genre is electronic dance music (edm), mainly trance and deep house music. I love dancing the night away with friendly people who love to have a good time. I am also very into poi and practice quite often.
